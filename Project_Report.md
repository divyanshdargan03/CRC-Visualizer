**Methodology:**  
Implemented using modern web technologies (HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript) following an iterative development approach with focus on user experience and visual feedback.

**Results/Findings:**  
Successfully created a responsive web application that provides step-by-step CRC calculation visualization, supports multiple input formats, demonstrates error detection, and includes features like dark mode and animated UI elements for enhanced user experience.

## 3. Introduction

### Background
Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC) is a crucial error-detecting code widely used in digital networks and storage devices. Understanding its operation is fundamental for computer network students, yet the binary polynomial division process can be abstract and difficult to grasp.

### Motivation
The need for an interactive, visual tool that breaks down the CRC calculation process into understandable steps, making it easier for students to learn and verify their understanding of error detection mechanisms.

### Project Scope
- Interactive calculation of CRC with step-by-step visualization
- Support for different input formats (Binary, Decimal, Hexadecimal)
- Error simulation and detection demonstration
- Polynomial visualization in both mathematical and binary forms
- Sender and Receiver mode operations
- Dark/Light theme support for extended usability

### Objectives
1. Provide real-time CRC calculation with detailed step visualization
2. Demonstrate error detection capabilities through simulation
3. Support multiple input formats and polynomial selections
4. Create an intuitive interface for both sending and receiving operations
5. Ensure accessibility through responsive design and theme options

### Expected Outcome
A comprehensive learning tool that makes CRC concepts more accessible and understandable through visualization and interaction.

## 5. System Design & Architecture

### 5.1 Software System Design

#### System Overview
The CRC Visualizer is a client-side web application that performs real-time CRC calculations and visualizations. The system consists of three main components:
1. Input Processing & Format Conversion
2. CRC Calculation Engine
3. Visualization & User Interface

#### Software Architecture
- **Frontend Components:**
  - Input Handler (format conversion, validation)
  - CRC Calculator (polynomial division implementation)
  - Visualization Engine (step-by-step display)
  - UI Components (theme switcher, mode selector)

#### Technologies Used
- HTML5 for structure
- CSS3 for styling and animations
- JavaScript (ES6) for functionality
- CSS Variables for theming
- LocalStorage for persistence

### 5.2 Requirement Hardware System
- Any modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Minimal system requirements as it's a client-side application
- No special hardware requirements

#### Core Algorithm
```javascript
// Pseudo-code for CRC calculation
function calculateCRC(input, polynomial):
    1. Convert input to binary if needed
    2. Append zeros (length = polynomial degree)
    3. Perform binary polynomial division:
        - XOR current bits with polynomial
        - Record each step
    4. Return remainder (CRC)

function verifyMessage(message, polynomial):
    1. Perform division on entire message
    2. Check if remainder is zero
    3. Return verification result
```
